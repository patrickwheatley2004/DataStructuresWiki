# DataStructuresWiki
DataStructuresWiki is a program that allows you to store 11 Data Structures in a 2D Array and display information regarding them.
This information includes: Name, Category, Structure and Definition. Either of these fields can be edited too. None of the fields can be blank.
You can also add your own Definitions and delete definitions too. 
To see this information it is shown in the listview on the right of the screen. 
You can also save and load your information to and from a file. 
There is full error handling so no exceptions go through. And if the user makes an error a messagebox will pop up and tell the user what went wrong. 
There is a statusStrip at the bottom so whenever there is a change that isn't urgent a messagebox doesn't pop up.
